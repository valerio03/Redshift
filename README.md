# ðŸ©¸ RedShift: Malaria Infected RBC Detector

RedShift is a deep learning-based web application built with **Streamlit** that detects malaria infection in red blood cells (RBCs) from microscopic images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify cells as **Parasitized** or **Uninfected**, aiding medical diagnostics.
